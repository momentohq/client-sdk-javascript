 * Parent response type for a cache delete request.  The
 * response object is resolved to a type-safe object of one of
 * the following subtypes:
 *
 * - CacheDelete.Success
 * - CacheDelete.Error
 *
 * `instanceof` type guards can be used to operate on the appropriate subtype.
 * @example
 * For example:
 * ```
 * if (response instanceof CacheDelete.Error) {
 *   // Handle error as appropriate.  The compiler will smart-cast `response` to type
 *   // `CacheDelete.Error` in this block, so you will have access to the properties
 *   // of the Error class; e.g. `response.errorCode()`.
 * }
