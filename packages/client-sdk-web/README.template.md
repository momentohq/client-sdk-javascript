## Packages

The JavaScript Web SDK is available on npmjs: [`@gomomento/sdk-web`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gomomento/sdk-web).

The web SDK is the best choice for client-side JavaScript applications, such as code that will run in a browser.  For
node.js server-side applications, check out the [Momento Node.js SDK](../client-sdk-nodejs).

## Usage

```javascript
{% include "./examples/web/cache/readme.ts" %}
```

## Getting Started and Documentation

Documentation is available on the [Momento Docs website](https://docs.momentohq.com).

## Examples

Working example projects, with all required build configuration files, are available in the [examples](../../examples/web) subdirectory.

## Developing

If you are interested in contributing to the SDK, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) docs.
