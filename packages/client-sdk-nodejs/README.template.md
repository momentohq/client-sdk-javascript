## Packages

The node.js SDK is available on npmjs: [`@gomomento/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gomomento/sdk).

The node.js SDK is the best choice for server-side JavaScript applications or environments where performance considerations
are key.  If you are writing a browser application or other JavaScript code that will run outside of node.js, check out
the [Momento Web SDK](../client-sdk-web).

## Usage

```javascript
{% include "./examples/nodejs/cache/readme.ts" %}
```

## Getting Started and Documentation

Documentation is available on the [Momento Docs website](https://docs.momentohq.com).

## Examples

Working example projects, with all required build configuration files, are available in the [examples](../../examples/nodejs) subdirectory.

## Developing

If you are interested in contributing to the SDK, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) docs.
