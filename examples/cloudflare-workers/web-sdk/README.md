# Using Momento inside a Cloudflare Worker through the Web SDK

This example uses
[Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) to create a
typescript worker and interacts with Momento using its Web SDK.

The Web SDK is heavier-weight than using Momento's HTTP API; you need to add a dependency on the SDK.
However, it supports the full Momento API (including collections like Dictionaries and SortedSets, plus the ability to publish to Momento Topics).
It also has a complete TypeScript/JavaScript API that makes it simpler to write code to interact with Momento. This can save you time
and effort when developing your Worker.

## How to use

- First, clone the example and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-javascript.git
cd client-sdk-javascript/examples/cloudflare-workers/web-sdk
npm install
```

- Next, if you don't have one already, create a cache inside the [Momento console](https://console.gomomento.com/caches).


### Setting up Momento Authentication
- In the Momento console, generate an [API key for your cache](https://console.gomomento.com/tokens), making sure to choose the same AWS region you used to create the cache. You'll want to use a `Fine-Grained Access Key` with read/write permissions for the cache you created.

- Copy the `API key` value from the API key generation screen for use in the next two steps.

- Update the `.dev.vars` file in the example directory with the Momento API key. Since this is a secret key, we donâ€™t store it as an environment variable, instead storing it as a Cloudflare secret.
- Cloudflare uses a file called wrangler.toml to configure the development and publishing of a worker. More information about Cloudflare configuration can be found [on their website](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/). In the example directory, update the `wrangler.toml` file and set the `MOMENTO_CACHE` environment variable to match the name of the cache you created earlier. Note that we need to explicitly uncomment the below 2 lines by removing the `#` sign and with the updated data.
```bash
[vars]
MOMENTO_CACHE_NAME = "myCache"
```
- Start the development server:

### Running locally

```bash
npm run start
```

- Open your browser to [localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787). The code in this example sets an item in the cache, gets it, and returns it as a JSON object:
   ```
    // setting a value into cache
    await client.set(cache, key, value);

    // getting a value from cache
    const getResponse = await client.get(cache, key)

		return new Response(JSON.stringify({ response: getResponse.toString() }));
    ```

A deployed example can be found [here](https://momento-cloudflare-worker-web.pratik-37c.workers.dev/).

### Deploying to CloudFlare

If you would like to deploy this example to your own Cloudflare worker, make sure you add the MOMENTO_API_KEY as a secret inside your Cloudflare account:

```shell

npx wrangler secret put MOMENTO_API_KEY
> Enter a secret value: **************************
> ðŸŒ€ Creating the secret for the Worker "momento-cloudflare-worker-web"
> âœ¨ Success! Uploaded secret MOMENTO_API_KEY
```

Then you can run `npm run deploy`. You will be prompted for a Cloudflare login before deploying to your Cloudflare account.
