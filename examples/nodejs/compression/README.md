TODO: once we have shipped the alpha version of the compression feature, this directory needs a package.json file, and
we need to update the CI tasks to build and run the example code in this directory so that we can ensure that it is
up to date. For now we just have some example code that is not exercised in CI, for the sake of injecting into the
README.
