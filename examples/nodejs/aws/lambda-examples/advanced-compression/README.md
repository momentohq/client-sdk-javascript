# Momento Node.js SDK - AWS Lambda Advanced (`zstd`) Compression Example

## What's this example all about?

Enabling compression in the Momento SDK can result in significant reductions in bandwidth consumption and costs, if your
cache values are, for example, large text strings (such as JSON objects). The default Momento compression extensions
library (`@gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression`) uses the `zlib` library, which is built-in to the Node.js standard library,
so it doesn't require any special packaging considerations when running in a lambda environment.

For advanced use cases, the `@gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression-zstd` library offers support for compression via `zstd`,
which can offer some amount of performance benefits for especially large payloads (100kb or more). However, this extension
relies on a native binary that must match the architecture of your target deployment environment, so it requires some
special packaging considerations.

Unless you are certain that the extra performance is important, we recommend that you stick with the simpler
`@gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression` package. For advanced use cases, this directory contains an example of how to deploy
the `@gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression-zstd` dependency in your lambda.

**NOTE: this binary will increase the size of your deployed lambda by approximately 1MB.**

## Packaging Notes

### `package.json`: Specifying the dependency for the target platform

The key to successfully packaging your lambda when using `@gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression-zstd` is to make sure that you
package the appropriate native `zstd` binary for your target environment. This example project targets a Linux, x64 Lambda
runtime, but assumes that you may be building / deploying the code from MacOS or another non-linux platform.

The `zstd` binaries are installed into the `node_modules` directory by `npm`. By default, `npm` will only install the appropriate
binary for the platform that you are running the build from. To ensure that the correct binary for the target platform is
also installed, you need to explicitly reference it in the `package.json` file. In this example, this is done via
the following line in the `dependencies` section of our `package.json`:

```json
"@mongodb-js/zstd-linux-x64-gnu": "^1.2.0",
```

If you were targeting a different platform, you could specify the appropriate dependency for your target platform here instead of
the `linux-x64-gnu` version.

### `esbuild.ts`: Special handling for `.node` files

This project uses `esbuild` to create the final files that we will deploy to the lambda. `npm` installs the native binaries
into the `node_modules` with a file extension of `.node`, and by default, `esbuild` will not include these files in the
build output. Therefore we need to configure `esbuild` to include these files.

For example code on how to achieve this, see the `esbuild.ts` file. If you are using another build system besides esbuild,
you will need to take similar steps to ensure that the `.node` files are included and accessible in your final lambda package.

## Building the Example

**NOTE: the `--force` flag is necessary on the `npm install` command if you are building from a different platform than
the lambda target platform. Otherwise `npm` will error out and indicate that your platform and arch are not suitable
for the `zstd-linux-x64-gnu` dependency that is listed in the `package.json` file.**

To build the code and package the lambda .zip artifact:

```bash
npm install --force
npm run build
```

At this point, you should have a `function.zip` file that contains the esbuild output and the linux x64 `zstd` binary.

## Deploy via AWS SAM

**NOTE: in this example project, we have the SAM `SkipBuild` metadata set to `True`, which means that the `sam build` command
will just use our `function.zip` file and create the template; it will not try to build the nodejs code itself. This is necessary
because we need to pass the `--force` flag to `npm install` when building the code, and SAM does not currently support this.**

See the `template.yaml` file to see how this `sam` project is setting up the lambda function. Note that the architecture
is set to `x86_64` (which matches our `zstd` binary dependency in `package.json`), and the runtime is set to `nodejs20.x`

Here are the commands you need to run to deploy the lambda via SAM:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --stack-name <YOUR PREFERRED STACK NAME HERE> \
           --resolve-s3 \
           --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
           --parameter-overrides MomentoApiKey=<YOUR MOMENTO API KEY HERE>
```

**NOTE: in this example we are passing the `MomentoApiKey` parameter to `sam` as a plain-text Parameter. This is not recommended
for production use cases; you should use AWS Secrets Manager or another secure way of storing your key.**

If you are running the `sam build` and `sam deploy` commands from the same target architecture that you are using for the
lambda, then you won't need the `--force` flag, so you can allow SAM to manage the `esbuild` step for you. To do that you
could modify the `template.yml` file to set `CodeUri` to `./src/index.ts`, and include this build metadata:

```yaml
    Metadata:
      SkipBuild: True
      BuildMethod: esbuild
      BuildProperties:
        UseNpmCi: true
        Minify: false
        Target: "es2020"
        Sourcemap: true
        Loader:
          - ".node=copy"
        EntryPoints:
          - src/index.ts
```

### Deploy Via AWS CLI

To deploy via the AWS CLI, you will first need to create the Lambda function. The easiest way to do this is in the
AWS Console. **Make sure you choose the `NodeJS 20` runtime and the `x86_64` architecture.**

You will also need to set the `MOMENTO_API_KEY` environment variable for the function. You can do this through the Configuration
tab in the AWS Console.

Once you have created your lambda function, you can deploy the code to it with this command:

```bash
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name <YOUR FUNCTION NAME HERE> --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

And then you can invoke it with this command:

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name <YOUR FUNCTION NAME HERE> --log-type Tail result.json | jq -r .LogResult | base64 -d
```
